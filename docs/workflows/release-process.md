## Release Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow Template

```yaml
name: Release Pipeline
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  validate-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate Release
        run: ./scripts/validate_release.sh
      
  build-artifacts:
    needs: validate-release
    strategy:
      matrix:
        platform: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        target: [x86_64, arm_cortex_m7]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build Release Artifacts
        run: |
          cmake -B build -DTARGET_PLATFORM=${{ matrix.target }}
          cmake --build build --config Release
      - name: Package Artifacts
        run: ./scripts/package_release.sh ${{ matrix.target }}
      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: liquid-vision-${{ matrix.target }}
          path: dist/

  create-release:
    needs: build-artifacts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Download Artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body_path: RELEASE_NOTES.md
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
```

### Semantic Versioning

#### Version Bumping Rules
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes, architecture changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible changes
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security patches

#### Automatic Version Detection
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/bump_version.sh

current_version=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
commit_messages=$(git log ${current_version}..HEAD --oneline)

if echo "$commit_messages" | grep -q "BREAKING CHANGE\|feat!"; then
    echo "major"
elif echo "$commit_messages" | grep -q "feat:"; then
    echo "minor"
else
    echo "patch"
fi
```

## Quality Gates

### Mandatory Checks
- [ ] All tests passing (100% success rate)
- [ ] Code coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Security scan with no critical issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within thresholds
- [ ] Documentation build successful
- [ ] Legal review completed (for major releases)

### Safety-Critical Validation
- [ ] Hardware-in-loop testing passed
- [ ] Fault injection testing completed
- [ ] Emergency procedures validated
- [ ] Regulatory compliance verified (when applicable)

### Performance Validation
```bash
# Performance thresholds
MAX_INFERENCE_TIME_MS=25
MAX_MEMORY_USAGE_KB=256
MIN_ACCURACY_PERCENT=85

# Automated validation
./scripts/validate_performance.sh \
    --max-inference-time $MAX_INFERENCE_TIME_MS \
    --max-memory $MAX_MEMORY_USAGE_KB \
    --min-accuracy $MIN_ACCURACY_PERCENT
```

## Risk Management

### Pre-Release Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**: Breaking changes, performance regressions
2. **Security Risks**: New attack vectors, dependency vulnerabilities  
3. **Operational Risks**: Deployment issues, rollback capabilities
4. **Safety Risks**: Flight safety impacts, emergency procedures

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Emergency rollback script
#!/bin/bash
PREVIOUS_VERSION=$1

echo "Rolling back to version: $PREVIOUS_VERSION"
git checkout "v$PREVIOUS_VERSION"
docker pull liquid-vision:$PREVIOUS_VERSION
./scripts/deploy_rollback.sh $PREVIOUS_VERSION
```

### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Development team, stakeholders
- **External**: Users, community, regulatory bodies
- **Emergency**: Incident response team, safety officers
