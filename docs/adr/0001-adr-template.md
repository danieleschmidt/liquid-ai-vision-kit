# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a standardized format for documenting important architectural decisions in the liquid-ai-vision-kit project. This will help maintain institutional knowledge and provide context for future development decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural choices. Each ADR will follow this template structure:

### Template Structure

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short descriptive title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem that this decision addresses]

## Decision

[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

[Describe the consequences of this decision, both positive and negative]

## Alternatives Considered

[List and briefly describe alternatives that were considered]

## References

[Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or external resources]

## Date

[Date the decision was made]
```

### Numbering Convention

- ADRs will be numbered sequentially starting from 0001
- Numbers will be zero-padded to 4 digits
- The title should be concise and descriptive

### File Naming

ADR files will be named: `XXXX-descriptive-title.md`

Example: `0002-liquid-network-fixed-point-arithmetic.md`

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of important decisions
- Historical context for future maintainers
- Structured decision-making process
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain
- May slow down rapid prototyping

## Alternatives Considered

1. **GitHub Issues/Discussions**: More informal but lacks structure
2. **Wiki Documentation**: Could become outdated and scattered
3. **Code Comments**: Too granular and hard to find
4. **Design Documents**: Too heavyweight for many decisions
